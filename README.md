### The App:

I want to build an application/blog about sports betting called "Dog Pass". This app is specifically about the betting underdogs. Users will post bets (from Vegas odds, Draft Kings, etc) and receive feedback from other users on whether or not betting on the underdog is worth it. Feedback will come in the form of comments. The stretch goal would be to have users be able to thumbs up or thumbs down on a post
